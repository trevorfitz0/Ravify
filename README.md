<h1 align=center>Ravify</h1>

## Abstract
Ravify is a react Application which is centralized around the spotify for devs API. The main goal of this Application is to first log a user in using their spotify account then grab their top artist data from all time. Once the Artist data is retrived the application lets the user choose between 1 of 3 backdrops for their lineup then places their favortie artists in a festival lineup style on top of the backdrop.
## Project Viewing
Unfortunately, since the app uses Secret API Keys through Spotify's API, it's unable to be pulled down and run locally.

## Context
This application is our Mod 3 Final solo project, and I worked on it for roughly 20 hours.

## Learning Goals
- Learn how to use the spotify API
- Challenge my css skills with organizing lots of elements in a small place
- Create a multi-page UX utilizing React Router.

## Wins + Challenges
- Creating a very good looking festival lineup that is easily accessable for every spotify user
- A large challenge was Spotify's authentication, it takes about 4 rounds of API fetch's to get to the point where I have a users data
- One large challenge I am still working on is figuring out how to download the festival lineup as a PNG. I have found solutions but the way I wrote my code is making it a lot harder, I will maybe try converting the final product to a canvas to fix this issue.
